Any child who sees a plane in the sky fantasises about riding in it. Traveling by plane has become a craze, and as an adult, one will consider taking care of the experience. As a result, the opinions of those who have travelled have become increasingly important. This improved people's positive travel experiences, as well as the airlines' ability to understand what their customers are feeling and this increased the amount of room for improvement that airlines can do.

The main objective of this project is to predict whether passengers will refer the airline to their friends. In this project we deployed multiple machine learning models to see the performance.

Data includes airline reviews from 2006 to 2019 for popular airlines around the world with multiple choice and free text questions. Data is scraped in Spring 2019. The main objective is to predict whether passengers will refer the airline to their friends.
